Practice Exercise: Basketball

Write a program that asks for the score obtained by the Green Archers and Blue Eagles in a basketball game for each quarter (there are four quarters in total in a basketball game). Note that for each quarter the program should ask for the number of points obtained in that quarter only, not the total score after that quarter.

After four quarters, output the winner. If itâ€™s a tie, the program should say Overtime! and then ask for the number of points obtained by each team for the overtime round.
